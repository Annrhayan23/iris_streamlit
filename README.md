Sure! Here's a clean and professional `README.md` for your **Iris Flower Classification - Streamlit App** project:

---

## 🌸 Iris Flower Species Predictor (Streamlit App)

A simple and interactive machine learning web app that predicts the species of an Iris flower using user input features like petal and sepal dimensions. Built with **Streamlit** and **scikit-learn**.


---

### 🧠 Features

* Built using `Streamlit` and `scikit-learn`
* Uses the **Iris dataset** (built-in with scikit-learn)
* Trains a Random Forest Classifier
* Real-time prediction with slider input
* Lightweight and fast — runs locally

### 🛠️ Installation

#### 1. Clone the repository (or download the folder):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-streamlit-app.git
cd iris-streamlit-app
```

#### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1   # For Windows
# OR
source venv/bin/activate      # For Mac/Linux
```

#### 3. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can install manually:

```bash
pip install streamlit scikit-learn pandas
```

---

### ▶️ Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
